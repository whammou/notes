**** The Anatomy of a Commit Message
- *Basic:*
  ~git commit -m <message>~
- *Detailed:*
  ~git commit -m <title> -m <description>~
**** 5 Steps to write a better commit message
- Note taken on [2024-09-21 Sat 21:37] \\
  To come up with thoughtful commits consider the following: 
  - Why have I made these changes?
  - What effect have my changes made?
  - Why was the change needed?
  - What are the changes in reference?
    
1. *Capitalization and Punctuation:*
   Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using /Convention Commits/, remember to use all lowercase
2. *Mood:*
   Use imperative mood in the subject line. *Example -* ~Add fix~ for ~dark mode toggle state~. Imperative mood fives the tone you are giving in /order/ or /request/
3. *Type of Commit:*
   Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have consistent set of words to describe your changes. *Example:* /Bugfix/, /Update/, /Retractor/, /Bump/, and so on.
4. *Length:*
   The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 chars, and the body should be restricted to 72 chars
5. *Content:*
   Be direct, try to eliminate fillers words and phrases in theses sentences (*Example:* though, maybe, I think, kind of), Think like a journalist
**** Conventional Commits
Conventional Commit is a formatting convention that provides as set of rules to formulate a consistent commit message structure like so:

#+NAME: Conventional Commit structure
#+BEGIN_SRC
<type>[option scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
#+END_SRC

The commit ~type~ can include the following:

- ~feat~ -a new feature is introduces with the changes
- ~fix~ -a bug fix has occurred
- ~chore~ -changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- ~refractor~ -refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- ~doc~ - updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files
- ~style~ -changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely realted to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on
- ~test~ -including new or correcting previous tests
- ~perf~ -performance improvements
- ~ci~ -continuous integration related
- ~build~ -changes tha affect the build system or external dependencies
- ~revert~ -reverts a previous commit
  
/The commit type subject line should be all lowercase with a character limit to encourage succinct descriptions/

The ~[optional commit body]~ should be used to provide detail that cannot fit within the character limitations of the subject line description

It is also good location to utilize ~BREAKING CHANGE: <description>~ to note the reason for a breaking change within the commit

The ~[footer]~ is also optional. We use the footer to link the JIRA story what would be closed with these changes for example:
~Closes D2!I-<JIRA #>~

#+NAME: Full Conventional Commit Example
#+BEGIN_SRC
fix: fix foo to enable bar

This fixes the broken behavior of the component by doing xyz. 

BREAKING CHANGE
Before this fix foo wasn't enabled at all, behavior changes from <old> to <new>

Closes D2IQ-12345
#+END_SRC

> The ensure that these committing conventions remain consistent across developers, commit message linting can be configured before changes are able to be pushed up.
