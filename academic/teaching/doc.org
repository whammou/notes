- [X] *OBJECTIVE:* Understand why integration is called anti-derivative
- [X] *OBJECTIVE:* Teaching on units and how use them to your advantage
- [ ] *OBJECTIVE:* Link between units and anti-derivative
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-07-07 08:48]:
  1. =Integration= is called an =anti-derivative= is because it is literally an anti/undo of an =derivative=
     1. *Antiderivative:* An =antiderivative= of a /function/ $\mathit{f}(x)$ is a /function/ $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = \mathit{f}(x)$. In the other words, $F(X)$ is a /function/ whose =derivative= gives back the original /function/ $\mathit{f}(x)$
     2. *Integral:* The =integral= of a /function/ (indefinite =integral= or an =antiderivative=) is denoted as $\int \mathit{f} (x) \,dx$. This represent a family of /functions/ $F(x) + C$, where $C$ is a *constant*. The process of integration can be thought of as finding an =antiderivative=
  2. =Units= are the formulas to approach a problem e.g. $S = 1 (m^2)$, $a = 1 \frac{m}{s^2}$
  3. What does =units= tell us about =integrations=
     1. Example: Area of a square
     2. Example: Connections between: speed, acceleration, and  displacement

- Formula $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ is =called a vertex form of a parabola=
  - A parabola form can be written as $y = ax^2 + bx + c$
  - And can be re-written as: $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$
    - *h*: is the /horizontal/ coordinate of the =vertex= (x)
    - *k*: is the /vertical/ coordinate of the =vertex= (y)
    - *a*: is the /coefficieent/
