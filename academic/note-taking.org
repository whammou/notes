* Note-taking

- *Goal(s):* learn effective note-taking method form lecture slides
- *Stumble upon:* [[https://zettelkasten.de/overview/][zettelkasten method]]

Combine Zettelkasten method with the Outline method for seamless integration with digital notes

** Outline method format

The Outline Method* is the most structured note-taking method, and visually looks very organized
- Add main points as headers and elaborate them underneath
- For each supporting information, create a nested bullet point below it
- Outline method also works very well with ~markdown~ and ~orgmode~

** Zettelkasten method format

The Zettelkasten method* is designed to help capture and organize knowledge for long-term reference and development
- Write an idea onto one card (a "zettel"), and store int in a box (a "kasten")
- Create connection between ~cards~ and with ~tags~
- This method works perfectly with ~orgmode~

*** The address of each note

- If you want to refer to an individual note, it needs to have a fixed and unique address 
- It is necessary to make the actual *lookup possible*
  /*Idea*: Use files path for unique address and thus easier to organize in categories/

**** Luhmann's numbering system

- The very first note is assigned ~no.1~, second related to ~no.1~ is assigned ~no.2~
- ~Injection~ or ~comment~ on the first note is assigned ~1a~, second note related to this note is assigned ~1b~. And comment on note ~1a~ is denoted as ~1a1~, and go on
- *Luhmann's numbering system*has two consequences for re-creating his method:
  1. It makes *organic growth* possible
  2. It make *linking* possible
  /Implement my own tag system inspired be Luhmann's/

*** Thinking and Writing

- Important trait of Zettelkasten
  1. It's hyper-textual
  2. It's adheres to the Principle of Atomicity
  3. It's personal

- *Hypertext -* texts that refers to each other, explain, expand and use each other's information
/To become hypertext a Zettelkasten system requires multiple notes that connect via hyperlinks and each note needs a unique link/
- [[#principle_of_atomicity][Principle of Atomicity]] - Each note contains one and only one unit of knowledge ~atom~
- *Personal -* Each person's zettelkasten is different from others

**** Principle of Atomicity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: principle_of_atomicity
:END:

*Principle of Atomicity -* each note record only one ~thought~ and each larger concept is the ~atom~ which includes a lot of individual ~thought~
  /This concept is hard to maintain and thus use markdown/orgmode ID to reference to a note is a better way to maintain the note and the structure of the note/

*** Anatomy of a Zettel

file:academic/assets/note-taking/SCR_33_2.png

- An *Anatomy of a Zettel* includes:
  1. A *Unique identifier -* This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address
  2. The *Body -* This is where to write down ~capture~ (a piece of knowledge)
  3. *Reference -* reference the source of the knowledge or thought
