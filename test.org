1. The point P on a rotating compact disc at $t=0$
2. As the disc rotate, P move through an arc length $s$

- The angle /theta/ is called the =angular position= (subtended by an
  =arc length= $s$ along a circle of radius r, measured in radians
  counterclockwise from the (+) x-axis) and is analogous to the linear
  position

$$\theta = \frac{s}{r} \text{ with } 360 \textdegree = 2 \pi \text{ } rad$$
** Angular Displacement
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: angular-displacement
:END:
- As a point on the compact disc moves from A to B, the disc rotates
  through the angle which is call =angular displacement=
  - The difference in its final and initial angles

$$\Delta \theta = \theta_f - \theta_i$$
** Angular Velocity (Speed)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: angular-velocity-speed
:END:
The =average angular velocity= is the average rate of change of the
angular displacement

$$\omega_{av} = \frac{\theta_f - \theta_i}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$$

If we let the time interval $\Delta t$ become shorter and shorter, we
are averaging over smaller and smaller time intervals, then the average
angular velocity becomes the =instataneous angular velocity=

$$\omega = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$$
** Angular Acceleration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: angular-acceleration
:END:
An object's =sverage acceleration= during the time interval is the
change in its =angular speed= divided by time interval

$$\alpha_{av} = \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$$

The =instataneous angular acceleration= is the limit of the average
angular acceleration as the time interval approaches zero

$$\alpha = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$$

- The =direction= of the angular velocity vector can be found with the
  [[./assets/w4-circular/example41.jpg][Right Hand Rule]]
- The =direction= of the angular =acceleration= and the angular
  =velocity= are
  - *Same* if the angular =speed= is /increasing/ with /time/
  - *Opposite* if the angular =speed= is /decreasing/ with /time/
** Rotation Motion Under Constant Angular Acceleration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rotation-motion-under-constant-angular-acceleration
:END:
=If the object undergoes rotation motion about a fixed axis under a constant angular accerleration, its motion can be described with the following set of equations which are in the similar manner to the linear 1D motion with constant accerleration:=

- Linear Motion with $a$ Constant

#+begin_quote
$$v = v_i + at$$

$$\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$$

$$v^2 = v^2_i + 2a \Delta x$$
#+end_quote

- Rotation Motion About a Fixed Axis with $\alpha$ Constant

#+begin_quote
$$\omega = \omega_i + \alpha t$$

$$\Delta \theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$$

$$\omega^2 = \omega^2_i + 2 \alpha \Delta \theta$$

*** Tangential Velocity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tangential-velocity
:END:
- The =tangential velocity= of a point on a rotating object equals the
  =distance= of that point from the axis of rotation /multiplied/ by the
  =angular velocity= $$v_t = r \omega$$
*** Tangential Acceleration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tangential-acceleration

- The =tangential acceleration= of a point on a rotating object equals
  to the =distance= of that point from the axis of rotation multiplied
  by the =angular acceleration=

- Consider /the circular motion of an object with constant speed/
  - (+) The =velocity vectors= have the same magnitude, corresponding
    for the same speed
  - (-) BUT =directions= are different
    - ==>= There exists an =accerleration vector= pointing inwards

- As the particle moves counterclockwise in time $\Delta t$ on the
  circular path
  - The =position vector= moves from
    $\vec{r}(t) \text{ to } \vec{r}(t + \Delta t)$
  - The =velocity vector= has constant magnitude and its tangent to the
    path as it changes from $\vec{v}(t)$ to \(\vec{v}(t + \Delta t)$,
    changing its direction only
  - Since =velocity vector= $\vec{v}(t)$ is /perpendicular/ to the
    =position vector= $\vec{r}(t)$. The triangle form from the
    =position vector= $\vec{\Delta r}$, and =velocity vector= and
    $\vec{v}$ are similar
  - Since $|\vec{r}(t)| = |\vec{r}(t + \Delta t)|$ and
    $|\vec{v}(t)| = |\vec{v}(t + \Delta t)|$
    - ==>=the two triangles are /isosceles/

Thus,

$$\frac{\Delta v}{v}  = \frac{\Delta r}{r} \text{ or } \Delta v = \frac{v}{r} \Delta r$$

$$a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v}{r} \left( \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \right) = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

$$a_c  = \frac{v^2}{r} \text{ and } a_c = \frac{r^2 \omega^2}{r} = r \omega^2$$
*** Varying Speed
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: varying-speed
:END:
- When an object moves in a circle but is /speeding up/ or /slowing
  down/
  - A =tangential component= of acceleration is also present
  - This =tangential component= and the =centripetal components= of
    acceleration are /perpendicular/ to each other

$$a = \sqrt{a^2_t + a^2_c}$$
*** Centripetal Force
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: centripetal-force
:END:
- Any object moving in a =circular= path must have a =net force= exerted
  on it that is directed toward the center of the path
