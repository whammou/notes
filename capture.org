- *Goal(s):* Read [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-Columns.html][PROPERTIES@orgmanual]] 
*** Property Syntax
A. Properties are key-value pairs. When they are associated with single entry or with a tree they need to inserted in to special drawer with the name ~:PROPERTIES:~, which has to located right below a headline, and its planning line
B. Depend on the value of ~org-use-property-inheritance~, a property set this way is associated either with a single entry, or with the subtree defined by the entry
C. Properties can be inserted at the buffer level. That means they apply before the first headline and can be inherited by all entries in a file. Property blocks defined before the first headline must be at the top of the buffer with only comments above them
   
\Note that a property can only have one try per drawer\

Property values set with the global variable ~org-global-properties~ can be inherited by all entries in all Org files
*** Special Properties
Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode features, like the TODO sate or the priority of an entry:

** TODO Write better commit messages
- *Goal(s):* Write better and more comprehensive commit messages

*** The Anatomy of a Commit Message
- *Basic:*
  ~git commit -m <message>~
- *Detailed:*
  ~git commit -m <title> -m <description>~
*** 5 Steps to write a better commit message
- Note taken on [2024-09-21 Sat 21:37] \\
  To come up with thoughtful commits consider the following: 
  - Why have I made these changes?
  - What effect have my changes made?
  - Why was the change needed?
  - What are the changes in reference?
    
1. *Capitalization and Punctuation:*
   Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using /Convention Commits/, remember to use all lowercase
2. *Mood:*
   Use imperative mood in the subject line. *Example -* ~Add fix~ for ~dark mode toggle state~. Imperative mood fives the tone you are giving in /order/ or /request/
3. *Type of Commit:*
   Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have consistent set of words to describe your changes. *Example:* /Bugfix/, /Update/, /Retractor/, /Bump/, and so on.
4. *Length:*
   The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 chars, and the body should be restricted to 72 chars
5. *Content:*
   Be direct, try to eliminate fillers words and phrases in theses sentences (*Example:* though, maybe, I think, kind of), Think like a journalist
*** Conventional Commits
Conventional Commit is a formatting convention that provides as set of rules to formulate a consistent commit message structure like so:

#+NAME: Conventional Commit structure
#+BEGIN_SRC
<type>[option scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
#+END_SRC

The commit ~type~ can include the following:

- ~feat~ -a new feature is introduces with the changes
- ~fix~ -a bug fix has occurred
- ~chore~ -changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- ~refractor~ -refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- ~doc~ - updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files
- ~style~ -changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely realted to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on
- ~test~ -including new or correcting previous tests
- ~perf~ -performance improvements
- ~ci~ -continuous integration related
- ~build~ -changes tha affect the build system or external dependencies
- ~revert~ -reverts a previous commit
  
/The commit type subject line should be all lowercase with a character limit to encourage succinct descriptions/

The ~[optional commit body]~ should be used to provide detail that cannot fit within the character limitations of the subject line description

It is also good location to utilize ~BREAKING CHANGE: <description>~ to note the reason for a breaking change within the commit

The ~[footer]~ is also optional. We use the footer to link the JIRA story what would be closed with these changes for example:
~Closes D2!I-<JIRA #>~

#+NAME: Full Conventional Commit Example
#+BEGIN_SRC
fix: fix foo to enable bar

This fixes the broken behavior of the component by doing xyz. 

BREAKING CHANGE
Before this fix foo wasn't enabled at all, behavior changes from <old> to <new>

Closes D2IQ-12345
#+END_SRC

> [!NOTE]
> The ensure that these committing conventions remain consistent across developers, commit message linting can be configured before changes are able to be pushed up.

  As an example, imagine that the preferred design option you have been working on with your design team is a rainwater capture system, one of the components is a tank to store the rainwater. During Preliminary Design you have determined that to take into consideration how climate change will affect future rainfall patterns you will need a greater tank volume. This means a larger tank which will add cost and may require a larger physical footprint. With the new cost calculated and footprint determined the design can be verified against the design constraints (which let’s assume included budget and maximum sizing).
