**** Property Syntax

A. Properties are key-value pairs. When they are associated with single entry or with a tree they need to inserted in to special drawer with the name ~:PROPERTIES:~, which has to located right below a headline, and its planning line

B. Depend on the value of ~org-use-property-inheritance~, a property set this way is associated either with a single entry, or with the subtree defined by the entry

C. Properties can be inserted at the buffer level. That means they apply before the first headline and can be inherited by all entries in a file. Property blocks defined before the first headline must be at the top of the buffer with only comments above them

\Note that a property can only have one try per drawer\

Property values set with the global variable ~org-global-properties~ can be inherited by all entries in all Org files

**** Special Properties

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode features, like the TODO sate or the priority of an entry:

- ~#+FILETAG: :FOO:BAR:~: notebook tag
