*** TODO Podcast on procrastination
- *OBJECTIVE:* Understand why we procrastinate and how to fix it
- *Reference:* [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBifDZwPiI4#__preview][How to defuse procrastination @Youtube]]
*** DOING PARA vs zettelkasten [%] :PKM:
- *OBJECTIVE:* Determine which =PKM= is more compatible with current workflow
- *Visit:* [[id:08c4ff53-dd44-419b-b305-23ccccba4250][Develop a hybrid PKM system @Orgmode]]
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-20 20:42]:
  PARA and Zettelkasten are very different in nature. While one excel in structural and coordinated notes the other is very chaotic and flexible. However a PKM does not obligated to just one method. There are attempts to mix these methods to create a suitable PKM system for ones knowledge and/or tasks management

**** DONE Learn PARA system :PARA:
CLOSED: [2025-06-21 Sat 13:23] DEADLINE: <2025-06-21 Sat 20:00>
- *OBJECTIVE:* Learn para system and compare it to current workflow
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-21 13:26]:
  PARA system is very similar to current =pkm= system with some key differences:
   - PARA notes live in a master directory wheres current system notes live sub-directories
   - PARA is not scalable with very large amount of notes and lack of cross referencing between notes
   - PARA is easy to setup but hard to maintain
   - PARA system is very suitable for tracking tasks and ideas

- *OBJECTIVE:* Taking advantage of orderly nature of PARA method and chaotic nature of zettelkasten methodologies simultaneously

**** DONE Tasks management
CLOSED: [2025-06-21 Sat 15:15]
- *OBJECTIVE:* How to keep daily agenda and notes in a zettelkasten system
- *Complication:* How to manage daily tasks with zettelkasten
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-21 14:00]:
  - Using PARA system to track and develop tasks
  - PARA acting as an index node for zettelkasten

**** TODO Ease of accessing information
- *OBJECTIVE:* How to easily access information from this system
- [-] *Issue:* [1/2]
  1. Zettelkasten notes are not easy to access via directory (the nature of the method)
  2. [X] Github does not support =id-link= e.g. =[[id:<uuid>]]=
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-22 02:46]:
  2. Workaround using =anchor links=

**** TODO Notes structure
- *OBJECTIVE:* Consider Ease of access for notes then develop a structure to access information from both systems
***** Note template
- *OBJECTIVE:* How should a note looks like
*** Take a look at Quantum Well
- *OBJECTIVE:* Learn about this interesting topic on PKM in mathematics/physics field
