=Risk management= is time consuming and can be perceived to get in the
way of progress and so might even be ignored * This behaviour touches on
being unethical which is the focus of a future topic * One approach is
to embrace failure, and report on it as a learning opportunity for
yourself and others

The start of the conceptual design marks a transition in the direction
of the engineering project. Now the objective is to solve that defined
problem * Specifically, the output from the =conceptual design= is a
preferred option * =Conceptual design= stage which can be broken into
two sub-stages * *Ideation* - The development of a range of suitable
design options using =divergent thinking= * *Screening* - The selection
of the best design option using =convergent thinking=

*** Ideation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ideation
:END:
- The engineering problems are usually complex in nature and will
  require innovative thinking to solve
- Ideation involves a balance between open creative problem solving and
  the constraints introduced through the design requirements
- There are ideation tools to create an inclusive environment where
  everyone can contribute their best ideas, /There are also some
  creativity tools to help/

[!WARNING] Even though you might think that these ideas won't be viable
that not a concern just now, you will be able to =screen= out the worst
ideas in the next sub-phrase

***** BRAINSTORMING
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: brainstorming
:END:
=Brainstorming= is a good tool for generating ideas when working in
teams. To complete a brainstorming activity * Make sure you have the
same working space (make sure you have your =design problem statement=
written somewhere to see) * Spend 5 minutes individually coming up with
as many ideas as you can that would solve that problem * Then collate
these ideas together in a =central space=. ==>= Now group these ideas
together and have individuals further explain their ideas * After this
individual phase open up =idea generation= to the whole group. * Adding
a new idea to an existing one * Keep going even if you think your idea
might be not feasible, someone else might be inspired and add their own
idea * At the end of this process you should have a page convened in
ideas

***** THE 'YES AND' TOOL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-yes-and-tool
:END:
Another way to build on the ideas of your is through a =yes and= tool *
Get set up with everyone in your design team in the same working space
and your design statement written somewhere to see * Individually take a
blank piece of paper and write down a single idea to answer the design
statement * When you have finished pass the idea to the group member to
your left and receive an idea from the group member to your right *
Looking at the new idea in front of you add in a suggestion for how this
idea could be improved or otherwise build on the idea. To help start
your statement with =yes and= * Repeat the above two steps passing
around the ideas and adding onto them until you receive your original
ideas * Take it in turn around the design teams to read out the chain of
ideas * At the end of this process you should have several developed
ideas

***** SCAMPER
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: scamper
:END:
Generating an entirely new idea from scratch can be difficult. Using
already existing ideas and solutions can with the SCAMPER tool can be
very helpful

***** FIELDS OF 'MATCEMIB'
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fields-of-matcemib
:END:
The tool "8 field of =MATCEMIB=" is great to increases the number of
creative ideas generated by students. To use the tool simply ask
yourself "could[Field] help in the meeting =design requirement="; where
[FIELD] is one of the following * Mechanical * Acoustic * Thermal *
Chemical * Electrical * Magnetic * Intermolecular * Biological

*** Creative Problem Solving
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: creative-problem-solving
:END:
In design, the critically thinking engineer will constantly review the
context and methods that are being used in the project and make
adjustment as necessary. The constant battle between =creativity= and
=conformity=, the engineer must be able to navigate and satisfy both

**** The Ideal Ultimate Result
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-ideal-ultimate-result
:END:
- =critical thinking= is important in problem defining
- =creaticity= is important is problem solving\\
- =Ideal Ultimate Result= - a method which aids the designer establish
  the direction for the system under consideration and also engages the
  designed in re-framing the situation

*** Level of Development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: level-of-development
:END:
Level of development (LOD) is and idea of how much detail you need to go
into during the conceptual design stage. Consider there 3 basics LOD

1. =Concpetual design stage= - perfectly normal to just be at the lowest
   level of development, we don't need more details and we can make
   estimates of the expected outcomes
2. =Preliminary design stage= - you will need to start adding more
   details into the design and you might use functional analysis to the
   determine the sub function
3. =Final design stage= - The is a much higher level of development and
   ultimately at this stage there is enough information that someone
   could manufacture that part. You would also know the precise cost and
   weight etc
